# application - Tells the script we just want the foreground windows "application" classname
# title - Tells the script we just want the foreground windows' title minus it's classname

#
# Now, I need to add OPTIONAL color arguments. Up to 4 different ones.  Polybar allows you to add
# formatting text to the label you want to display.  Right now, I have the application text
# and window text different colors.
